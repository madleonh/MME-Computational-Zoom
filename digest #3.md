This article talks about how cameras have changed drastically throughout the years and predicts what we might see in the future. It also explains how what we see as cameras nowadays are just a collection of software algorithms. It talks about Apple’s new Portrait Lighting feature, “It uses the dual cameras and the Apple-designed image signal processor to recognize the scene, create a depth map and separate the subject from the background. Machine learning is then used to create facial landmarks and add lighting over contours of the face, all happening in real time”.

In computational photography, there a two biases that I discovered. One of them is some people do not consider photography as an art form and insult other photographers who do. Sometimes photography is not taken as seriously as other art forms. Nowadays photography is accepted as an art form, but back then it was not.
The second bias which is more specific to the computational photography itself is that some people do not think computational photography is “real” photography. There is a big debate around this subject and most of the backlash is coming from photographers that have been around for longer and were in the field long before all this new technology came out. The fact that it is now easier to get things in focus and get the right exposure/aperture is frustrating for some lone-time artists. So, when some artists create work that uses these new technologies, they get backlash. They consider this to “lazy”. This is why some people still shoot with film cameras. Film cameras do not do any of the things cameras nowadays and create more work for the photographer. While this work can be rewarding for some people, others do not like this and think it is too time consuming. In my opinion, I think it is totally up to the artist. I think the idea behind the photo or the way the work is presented is the most important. Whether it was created using computational photography or film, it does not matter to me. A good photo is a good photo and to take a “good” photo, you need skill. While I can understand why some long-time photographers might find it frustrating, they need to understand that times are changing and these new technologies have created/are going to create some amazing things.

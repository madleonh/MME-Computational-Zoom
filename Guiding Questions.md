    Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?
  Computational photography is the process of combining multiple images into to create an image that would be impossible to take.
  Computational Photography. It is the technology a lot of smartphone cameras are using nowadays. It makes it easier to take good photos. “Computational photography takes a swarm of data from images or image sensors and combines it algorithmically to produce a photo that would be impossible to capture with film photography or digital photography in its more conventional form.”

This article talks about the changing relationship of the photographer and the camera and what might happen to it in the future. It states, “Computational photography takes a swarm of data from images or image sensors and combines it algorithmically to produce a photo that would be impossible to capture with film photography or digital photography in its more conventional form. Image data can be assembled across time and space, producing super-real high-dynamic range (HDR) photos–or just ones that capture both light and dark areas well”. They also state that a lot of the new research in computational photography has to do with smartphone technology. They say there will be 3D object capture, and things to do with augmented reality. It also talks about a camera that was developed called “Light” and one developed by Google called “Tango”. It also talks about the possibility of 3D VR photographic capture.
